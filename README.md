## Boredom-slayer

A boredom eliminator that gives you random things to do when you're bored.

### Features

- Generates a random thing to do from a list of activities
- Changes the generated thing when clicked on
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling

### Usage

Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser. Click on the "Click me to generate thing to do!" button to generate a random activity.

### Customization

You can customize the list of activities by editing the `thingsToDoWhenBored` array in the `index.html` file.

### How it works

The code for this project is simple. It first defines an array of things to do when bored. Then, it randomly selects an item from the array and displays it on the screen. When the user clicks on the button, the code randomly selects a new item from the array and displays it on the screen.
